    "## Diffusion Weighted Imaging (DWI)\n",
    "\n",
    "Diffusion imaging probes the random, microscopic motion of water protons by employing MRI sequences which are sensitive to the geometry and environmental organization surrounding the water protons. This is a popular technique for studying the white matter of the brain. The diffusion within biological structures, such as the brain, are often restricted due to barriers (eg. cell membranes), resulting in a preferred direction of diffusion (anisotropy). A typical diffusion MRI scan will acquire multiple volumes that are sensitive to a particular diffusion direction and result in diffusion-weighted images (DWI). Diffusion that exhibits directionality in the same direction result in an attenuated signal. With further processing, the acquired images can provide measurements which are related to the microscopic changes and estimate white matter trajectories. Images with no diffusion weighting are also acquired as part of the acquisition protocol."

    "In addition to the acquired diffusion images, two files are collected as part of the diffusion dataset. These files correspond to the gradient amplitude (b-values) and directions (b-vectors) of the diffusion measurement and are named with the extensions `.bval` and `.bvec` respectively. The b-value is the diffusion-sensitizing factor, and reflects the timing & strength of the gradients used to acquire the diffusion-weighted images. The b-vector corresponds to the direction of the diffusion sensitivity. Together these two files define the diffusion MRI measurement as a set of gradient directions and corresponding amplitudes."
